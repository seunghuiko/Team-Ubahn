# Team U-Bahn

### Project Description
**"Team U-Bahn"** is a psychophysiology project focused on understanding the relationship between physiology and behavior. It covers experimental design, biosignal acquisition (e.g., brain, cardiovascular, and skin activity), and data analysis in time and frequency domains. The project equips participants with practical skills in conducting and evaluating psychophysiological experiments using advanced tools and methods.
